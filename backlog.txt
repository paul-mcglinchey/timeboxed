ISSUES
- need to only allow users to access clients within a group if they belong to that group, store in user auth via UserFront
- refactor server to retrieve group access via auth (also pass in from front-end to specify the group to select from)
- refactor colour generations out of specific classes -DONE
	- make reusable
	- update server / db when colour is generated for a client / user without colour
- create tag component
	- use composition to create a user tag component
- activity log changes
	- should expose an enumerated type which allows for a task to be set (CRUD)
	- should allow an object to be set for reference (Client, session, group etc)
	- lowercase everything, can write formatting methods at FE
	- log the get requests for specific clients also
